/**
 * Styles for Gutenberg blocks
 *
 * Since WordPress v5.0, post authoring has been moved from a TinyMCE-based
 * editor to WordPress' own native system called Gutenberg.
 *
 * Many elements added to a Gutenberg post (images and galleries, for example)
 * are wrapped with a `.wp-block`-prefixed class, and have their own defaults
 * applied via a fairly opinionated injected stylesheet. I have disabled this
 * stylesheet for this theme because it overrides global styles and in several
 * cases breaks up the vertical flow of the page, e.g. by overriding margins
 * from the line height to `1em`.
 *
 * There are too many to keep overriding, so it seems neater to just make custom
 * styles for all these blocks.
 *
 * This page imports the styles for each block.
