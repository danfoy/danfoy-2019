/**
 * Global colours Stylesheet
 *
 * Colour variables for the default stylesheet. At some point I would like to
 * provide multiple colour schemes for the site, which will probably invove
 * refactoring to bring all colours over the site into a separate sheet. But
 * having the default colours set here using variables will save a lot of time.
